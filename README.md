# VoiceBlynk

Blynk is a Platform with iOS and Android apps to control Arduino, Raspberry Pi and the likes over the Internet. It's a digital dashboard where you can build a graphic interface for your project by simply dragging and dropping widgets.

This android app is an attempt to control arduino with voice commands we send from our app to blynk server which then controls the arduino and other hardware devices connected to the blynk app.
